# GeoJSON files of U.S. zip codes by Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) number

[zip_codes_for_the_us](zip_codes_for_the_usa/) contains GeoJSON files of U.S. zip codes grouped by their Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The files were created using [a TopoJSON of U.S. zip codes assembled by Jeff Friesen](https://gist.github.com/jefffriesen/6892860) and a table created by the [Department of Labor Office of Worker's Compensation](https://safelyhome.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/u-s-zip-codes-and-msas-on-a-convenient-table-thank-you-dol-owcp/) which matches zip codes with corresponding MSA numbers. 

Note that [MSA.tsv](MSA.tsv/) is a cleaned version of the original table. The accuracy of certain statistical analyses may be limited by the resolution of the original TopoJSON file.
